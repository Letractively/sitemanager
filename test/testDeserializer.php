The second, <a href="http://webdevstudios.com/2013/08/01/wds-welcomes-scott-kingsley-clark/" title="http://webdevstudios.com/2013/08/01/wds-welcomes-scott-kingsley-clark/">is Scott Kingsley Clark who has been hired by WebDevStudios</a> most widely known throughout the WordPress community as the man behind the popular <a href="http://pods.io/" title="http://pods.io/">Pods Framework</a> plugin. If you remember back in 2011, Scott put together a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sc0ttkclark/pods-development-framework-20" title="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sc0ttkclark/pods-development-framework-20">Kickstarter campaign</a> to fund the development of Pods 2.0. While he originally asked for $1,500 he managed to pull in over double that amount with $4,177. I reached out to Scott to not only talk about his new job, but what will be happening to his Pods Plugin. <span id="more-8248"></span></p>\n<div id="attachment_8285" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/PodsKickstarter.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/PodsKickstarter.jpg?resize=248%2C300" alt="Pods KIckstarter Campaign" class="size-medium wp-image-8285" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Successful Campaign Numbers</p></div>\n<p><strong>First off congratulations on being picked up by WDS, a great group of people. My first question is, can you give everyone an update as to what happened after Pods 2.0 was funded via Kickstarter in 2011. What happened to the money, how it was used and did you really meet the goal the campaign was created for?</strong></p>\n<p>When I took over the Pods project, I had a lot of lofty goals. At the time, I was working from home doing various contracting gigs, but wanted to spend more time on the Pods project to get it to the next step, which was what Pods 2.0 was envisioned to be. Pods hadnâ€™t received many donations and it wasnâ€™t covering all the time I was spending on it, but I still put in 110% on it. For 2.0, one of the goals was revamping the UI entirely, nothing left behind. We needed a better field manager, content creation screen, and ensure it all felt like WordPress itself as much as possible.</p>\n<p>There was a few other contributors with me who worked on the project off and on, but what we needed was a professional designer / UI person. We knew the only way to get one was to pay for it, and none of us could afford that sort of investment. I set out to take a few weeks off from my main gigs and commitments to work solely on getting Pods 2.0 out the door.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I planned it out all wrong. I started as soon as the Kickstarter made its goal, I didnâ€™t ask for enough cash to cover my time and the designerâ€™s time, the Amazon/Kickstarter fees took a chunk out, and I had to wait a few weeks after the Kickstarter completed to get the money into my bank account. I found a designer but everyone was busy and couldnâ€™t start anytime soon. I waited around for a few, but found that they couldnâ€™t commit enough time to the project to get it to where we needed it in that short of a timeline. Instead of waiting for the right people and paying once, I hopped around a few and paid for the bits of work each did, but nothing concrete came out of it all.</p>\n<p>By then it was too late, it was now approaching 2012, I was running out of steam to be able to carry it all on my shoulders again, and all my gigs that brought bread to the table began to pile up and need my attention again. I contacted Matt Mullenweg to get his input on how to grow the project and get more people involved. He was pretty busy, but when he followed up a few weeks later, he was very interested in helping me get back on track. He asked what we needed, I explained that I had been paying people out-of-pocket over time, and even had some developers helping pick up the slack working on monthly installments.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/CreateNewPods.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/CreateNewPods.jpg?resize=500%2C239" alt="Create New Pods" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8286" /></a></p>\n<p>Matt came up with a sponsorship arrangement that took care of the future ongoing costs to get things back on track. And just like that, Matt and Automattic had swooped in and saved the day. Over the next few months we were committing code left and right, I was speaking at WordCamp San Francisco about what I had learned about content types in WordPress, and we had a beta out shortly after.</p>\n<p>Since then, weâ€™ve continued development and have focused on a number of big features for Pods 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3. Weâ€™re currently in development with 2.4 now, with no plans to stop, and weâ€™re steadily growing our contributor list. We recently launched our <a href="http://pods.io/" title="http://pods.io/">new site</a> with a huge docs section to help make it easier for people to get started with Pods.</p>\n<p><strong>During the campaign you had one pledge of $1,000 or more which is the highest pledge available. The reward was to have a feature built into Pods that wasnâ€™t already on the road map for 2.0. Can you tell us what that feature ended up being?</strong></p>\n<p>That was pledged by one of my favorite clients, Gina and Anthony Nieves with MarkNet Group (<a href="http://marknetgroup.com/" title="http://marknetgroup.com/">http://marknetgroup.com/</a>), who graciously didnâ€™t want anything new, they just wanted to help us continue the project and get Pods 2.0 out the door. I still to this day consider Gina a mentor whom I owe a lot to. I hope one day I can pay it all forward to someone else in a similar situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Have you primarily made a living strictly from Pods development or have you worked with companies over the years as a consultant? Why the decision to work for one WordPress development agency?</strong></p>\n<p>In the beginning, Pods never really got many donations, even before I took over. We still donâ€™t get that many donations unfortunately, but Automatticâ€™s sponsorship helps us keep things gliding forward swiftly and covers our time spent on support and code.</p>\n<p>Iâ€™ve worked with a number of companies over the years while developing for Pods, each one has utilized Pods in some way and some have donated my development time towards the project. I even briefly had a trial run at Automattic but the timing was bad because we had just had our first daughter, I was still working a full-time contracting gig at the same time, and I just couldnâ€™t give it the 100% that it deserved. I was out on my own from about 2009 to 2011, at which point I jumped back into a full-time gig to get insurance coverage for our growing family.</p>\n<p>After our second daughter Violet was born in June of this year, I felt all of the memories flood back from when I was out on my own and spending more time with our first daughter Annabelle. That, along with buying our first house and my wife having some unfortunate complications postpartum and being unable to take the full load of watching both daughters, we decided it was time to give it a go again.</p>\n<p>This time around, I thought hey, I know some distributed companies are getting really solid now, let me reach out and see if I can find myself the best of both worlds. I contacted Brad and very quickly he responded with enthusiasm. I knew right away after we started talking about how his company operates, the projects it works on, and the team of talented people who I already looked up to, that this was the place for me.</p>\n<p><strong>Now that your officially an employee, fans and users want to know what plans if any do you have for the Pods Framework? Will development continue, will it be rolled into a WebDevStudios product or will development cease for a while?</strong></p>\n<p>Pods isnâ€™t going away, not any time soon. Automattic has made it possible for us to keep going full force and improve the project unilaterally. Weâ€™re looking for additional contributors to help with support and other areas, but weâ€™re doing well with what weâ€™ve got right now. I was able to take some of my income and the sponsorship funds to put one of our primary contributors into an indefinite monthly retainer. Heâ€™s currently helping improve our documentation, helping out with support, and helping fix bugs / triage our GitHub reports. Our next release will introduce Loop Fields functionality and some other cool stuff, keep an eye out for it!</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/PodsAutomattic.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/PodsAutomattic.jpg?resize=271%2C93" alt="Pods Automattic" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8287" /></a></p>\n<p>There hasnâ€™t been any discussion about rolling Pods into WebDevStudios in any way other than integrating it with their existing products and projects. Anything is possible in the future, but nothing will be done without fully understanding how it impacts Pods in the long-term. My goals that I will <strong>NOT</strong> stray from have remained: <strong>Keep Pods free for all, continue making it easier for people to develop with WordPress, and put any/all funds raised by the project back into it</strong>. In fact, Iâ€™ve been known to do contracting work and just tell them to donate it directly to the <a href="http://podsfoundation.org/donate/" title="http://podsfoundation.org/donate/">Pods Foundation</a>, a company I setup which accepts donations and keeps Pods alive for the long-term.</p>\n<h2>How About That</h2>\n<p>I want to thank Scott for candidly opening up regarding the troubles he experienced with planning, scheduling, and the allocation of funds after the successful Kickstarter campaign concluded. Until this interview, I was not aware that Matt Mullenweg had anything to do with supporting Scott and the Pods Framework plugin. Scott found himself between a rock and hard place and I think itâ€™s awesome that after Scott got in touch with Matt, that he stepped up, came to an agreement with Scott and now the plugin along with development is rolling along nicely. I think Scott will be a nice fit for WebDevStudios. It will be interesting to see a couple of WDS client sites utilizing Pods in interesting ways, if they choose to go that route. </p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/M2EQD0UVFBk" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 05 Aug 2013 23:15:25 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:20:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 1.8.1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://buddypress.org/?p=169388";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"http://buddypress.org/2013/08/buddypress-1-8-1/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1060:"<p>BuddyPress 1.8.1 is now available.

Since the day I discovered Further, Iâ€™ve been trying to figure out how I could make the theme work for WPTavern.com. The things I like most about it is the layout, the logo in the top left corner, the entire left hand column, and the 4-5 widget footer. Further was originally developed by Takashi Irie. Check out his <a href="http://themeshaper.com/2013/03/05/behind-the-design-of-the-further-theme/" title="http://themeshaper.com/2013/03/05/behind-the-design-of-the-further-theme/">behind the scenes post</a> on how the design came to be. Also, take a look around the ThemeShaper website as it was redesigned with Further.</p>\n<p>Some of you may be wondering why the Further theme is not available for purchase on WordPress.com anymore. Itâ€™s officially been retired as it will be offered for free as the default theme in WordPress 3.8. While in San Francisco, I was able to learn that amongst all of the commercial themes available on WordPress.com, Further had the <strong>lowest</strong> refund rate. 2014 will be the first default theme to have a magazine type layout. I reached out to the team dedicated to the 2014 project and Lance Willet had this to say: <span id="more-8240"></span></p>\n<p><strong>What are you folks aiming to do with 2014?</strong></p>\n<p>The Twenty Fourteen team for 3.8 is me (Lance Willett) plus Konstantin Obenland and Takashi Irie. Weâ€™ll put our â€œcore hatsâ€ on and keep everyone updated via the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/" title="http://make.wordpress.org/core/">http://make.wordpress.org/core/</a> blog and hold weekly office hours in IRC to coÃ¶rdinate the project; just like Twenty Thirteen development in 3.6.</p>\n<p>With Further as a great starting point, we aim to add a few additional features such as an Authors widget and a Contributors page template. Plus many bug fixes or small improvements as they come up during the 3.8 cycle.</p>\n<p><strong>Why the decision to use Further and how different will it look from the Further we see today?</strong></p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg picked it with the primary criteria of â€œmagazine themeâ€ with a clean design focused on content and reading. We think itâ€™s a great fit for a default theme because of its fresh design, great use of post formats, and amazing mobile styles.</p>\n<p>Not much different. Probably most of the changes will be under the hood â€” improving the code quality and matching core standards better â€” and better supporting older browsers and adding various accessibility improvements like ensuring proper color contrast.</p>\n<p>That said, any time a theme goes into the crucible of core development, it changes for the better. Looking at each line under a microscope, testing it out in every possible extreme situation. Iâ€™m confident weâ€™ll all be proud of the result.</p>\n<p><strong>How can people contribute to its development?</strong></p>\n<p>Nothing to announce officially yet. The leadership team for 3.8, led by Matt, will be posting to the Make Core P2 soon, hopefully next week. At that time weâ€™ll lay out the details of IRC office hours, checkpoints for keeping tabs on Twenty Fourteen development, and where people can best jump in and help.</p>\n<p>For now, interested parties can <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&status=reviewing&component=Bundled+Theme&summary=~Fourteen&group=milestone&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&order=priority" title="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&status=reviewing&component=Bundled+Theme&summary=~Fourteen&group=milestone&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&order=priority">bookmark this Trac view</a>: to watch the Twenty Fourteen tickets happen.</p>\n<p>Folks can also ping me on Twitter, @<a href="http://twitter.com/simpledream" title="http://twitter.com/simpledream">simpledream</a> â€” and Iâ€™ll make sure to contact everyone when weâ€™re ready to dive in.</p>\n<h2>My Feedback On Further</h2>\n<p>While I love the look and feel of Further, there are a couple of things that really turn me off. The first is the use of incredibly large featured images for blog posts. With the type of content this site produces, routinely finding images 600px and wider related to WP would be a challenge. I also donâ€™t like the pattern image that is shown for posts that donâ€™t use the featured image. Also, if you use a featured image that doesnâ€™t fill that area, you see the image plus the pattern which is ugly. This is something that will be addressed in 2014. While the entire site is aligned to the left part of the screen, I canâ€™t help but feel that the space on the right side of the screen is wasted and could be used for something else, such as a sidebar. However, I think the best use of this space would be to increase the width dedicated to the content section of the site. Also, it would be cool to see the entire site be responsive so that no matter what size screen the page is displayed on, it makes use of all available space. </p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/FurtherFeaturedImages.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/FurtherFeaturedImages.jpg?resize=500%2C381" alt="Featured Image In Further" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8275" /></a></p>\n<p>I love how it has pull quotes built-in and the right-hand sidebar takes care of content published with post formats. Iâ€™m excited to see what becomes of 2014 and how the general user base will manipulate the design. What are your thoughts on the use of Further as the default them in WordPress 3.8? What are some ideas or enhancements you would like to see incorporated? </p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/UYjnsnT_u5w" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 05 Aug 2013 19:45:27 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:20:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"WPTavern: The Daily Plugin â€œPower Stacksâ€ â€“ My Shortcodes with Random Text";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=8096";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:122:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/MpM3cwX5Udk/the-daily-plugin-power-stacks-my-shortcodes-with-random-text";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9328:"<p>Today I am going to start what I hope is a semi-regularly occurring feature segment of The Daily Plugin series called â€œ<em>Plugin Power Stacks</em>â€ where I will show a â€œ<em>Trick</em>â€ or â€œ<em>Hack</em>â€ for a few plugins that work together to get some added functionality out of your WordPress installation, whether that be in content creation, administration or user interaction. Todayâ€™s installment involves solving the two common problems when dealing with content that changes frequently or is date dependent, even if itâ€™s just a sentence. <span id="more-8096"></span></p>\n<p>If there are two things that I use frequently in my â€œ<em>campaign-based</em>â€ sites itâ€™s the ability to create my own shortcodes, and the ability to pull content or keywords at random as if I were to draw a name out of a hat, or as complex as 20 different products that people could buy, with full HTML code cycling at random and embedded with a single shortcode. Here are two plugins that I found to be absolutely <strong>DEADLY</strong> when power stacked together. I know there are many more possibilities and I hope those that read this will share their own 1-2 punch combos that you use as well.</p>\n<p>Hereâ€™s todayâ€™s WordPress Plugin Tag Team of Doom: <strong>Random Text and My Shortcodes.</strong></p>\n<div id="attachment_8174" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/pantsonhead/"><img class=" wp-image-8174  " alt="Wordpress Developer PantsOnHead." src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pantsonhead.jpeg?resize=90%2C90" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><a title="PantsOnHead" href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/pantsonhead/" target="_blank"><strong>PantsOnHead</strong></a></p></div>\n<p><a title="Random Text WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/randomtext/" target="_blank">Random Text</a> is from a developer named â€œPantsOnHeadâ€ from New Zealand. Iâ€™m not kidding. Thatâ€™s the manâ€™s name. But he might want to change that soon, because this plugin is killer and he needs to be recognized! This is one of the more colorful of profile images that Iâ€™ve seen in a while, so I just had to share. This plugin allows you to create random blocks of text or HTML that are called up by shortcode. You can add them based on their own unique category. For example, if I want to add a list of colors that Iâ€™d like to display at random, I can do it in a few different ways.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/randomtext1-bulkinsert.png" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8262" alt="Random Text Plugin - Bulk Insert" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/randomtext1-bulkinsert.png?resize=150%2C150" /></a>First I can add a list of brands one line at a time and select â€œ<em>bulk add</em>â€œ. Bulk add allows you to line delimit your entries and add a massive list all at once. As long as there is a hard-line break in what you are pasting, it will add in mass. This could include full HTML code with embedded images and links, or a full paragraph. It knows when to delimit the import when it detects a return to the next line. Another way to add content is one at a time, allowing for full pages and/or code inserts to come up at random based on a shortcode. I like to consider the categories as <strong>buckets</strong> from which to pull from in future posts.</p>\n<p>Examples of some of the other basic content types Iâ€™ve also loaded into categories could include a â€œbucketâ€ of first names that are gender specific, city names, pet names or even simple banner codes to display. On the more advanced end, you can include fully blown scripts for displaying just about anything you want at random. The shortcode is used by evoking something like [randomtext category="colors"] which would display the item in order of the list, whereas a shortcode callout like [randomtext category="colors" random="1"] would display the same list, but in random order. The real limitations that I found were when I needed to insert random items that needed to be included in quotes, such as alt tags or titles, the plugin had problems getting things lined up exactly as planned.</p>\n<p>With that issue in mind, we now move to a solution in the plugin titled <strong><a title="My Shortcodes" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/my-shortcodes/" target="_blank">My Shortcodes</a></strong> by <a title="David Cramer WordPress Profile" href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/desertsnowman/" target="_blank">David Cramer</a>. This plugin is very complex, and can even be used to <strong>output OTHER PLUGINS</strong> in the Pro version, but more on that later. Though I only used it in a limited way, My Shortcodes allows you to create amazing shortcodes of your own creation. This includes using other shortcodes within itâ€™s code, which is the solution to our particular problem with Random Text.</p>\n<p>Before I merged this particular plugin with Random Text, I used to use it to help with updating content that was date dependent. The first of every month I simply modify one shortcode that I created to reflect the current month. So in my content, I can simply use something like â€œThis deal is good throughout the month of [month], [year] and well into [next-month] as well.â€ Instead of having to edit a hundred old posts to remain relevant, I can simply change the value of what [month] represents to reflect the current month.</p>\n<p>This plugin is meant to be a fire-breathing dragon right out of the gate. With it you can create custom shortcode elements or even download and install shortcodes made by other My Shortcodes users. It features areas for HTML/text entry, java script input, custom PHP libraries, external/CDN css and java script sources. Talk about loaded with plenty of firepower! You create anything you need in any format, name a shortcode of your own choosing, and it works!</p>\n<p>Returning to the combo with Random Text. What we are now able to do is add the previous shortcode of [randomtext category="colors" random="1"] and just use [color] instead. Nothing fancy there. But imagine when you have proper short codes and random text setup so you can create a fully css integrated panel with a background set to your chosen random color, and a buy button of the same shade. Or even a cycling of images with affiliate links embedded in them that display completely formatted. In my case, I use it in a simple form of â€œChoose from top brands like [store-topbrand],Â [store-topbrand] andÂ [store-topbrand]â€ and it would output the top brands at random. If I chose to use an HTML coded link with proper description attributes, I could also use that in the â€œtop brandâ€ designator and it would like to the brand pages.</p>\n<p>In the advanced text manipulation end, I use My Shortcodes to embed a sponsor block at the end of my show notes in my music podcast. Every one of the 13 sponsors that I have has random text content, from how I call something a â€œcouponâ€ or â€œpromo codeâ€ at random to the anchor text that is used to drive traffic to another page on my site. I start on the sentence level, then work to the whole paragraph. What can be randomized and pulled from the â€œbucketâ€ is included as long as it makes sense. I can stuff one shortcode from Random Text into My Shortcodes and go back and forth again. Once the paragraph is finished with all the Random Text shortcodes woven in, I then create a single shortcode for the whole â€œblockâ€.</p>\n<p>Now, when I want to insert the entire sponsor block in my show notes, I simply insert [sponsor1-block] and the entire formatted paragraph is perfectly placed in line. It gets even deeper. If I add each one of my sponsor blocks back into Random Text, I can then create a shortcode that displays only one of my sponsors at a time, at random. Another benefit to this method is that if an affiliate link changes, I simply have to change it in one line in the admin panel and itâ€™s fixed throughout.</p>\n<p>I know that I cannot do the My Shortcodes proper justice as far as describing its full potential, but I can tell you that it allows me to create a lot of shortcuts for things that I normally would have to create a lot of content for, or around. It allows me to split test on a massive scale, and change things on the back-end with seamless integration. In its most advanced form though, it allows you to create actual plugins from the My Shortcode system, where you can create your own custom plugins based on the data that is output. Very cool indeed.</p>\n<p>If you happen to use either of the plugins suggested today, please consider making a nice contribution to them in any way you can. They have created some really great, functional plugins that completely expand how you think about creating your content.</p>\n<p>I am interested in the feedback of others out there about their own plugin â€œstackingâ€. Sometimes, just one plugin wonâ€™t get you â€œacross the bridgeâ€ and you simply need two to get you there. Itâ€™s often tough to think of these power combos until a need arises, so the more we share, the more we learn.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/MpM3cwX5Udk" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 05 Aug 2013 17:54:27 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Marcus Couch";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:20:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"Matt: Public-Private Surveillance";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=42785";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:49:"http://ma.tt/2013/08/public-private-surveillance/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:205:"<p>Bruce Schneier on <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-31/the-public-private-surveillance-partnership.html">The Public-Private Surveillance Partnership</a>.

<a title="A Spammy Year in Review - Akismet" href="http://blog.akismet.com/2012/12/21/a-spammy-year-in-review/">our 2012 year in review post</a>, we explained that, without surprise, spam levels were greatly on the rise. We are a bit beyond the halfway point of 2013 and wanted to post an update on what weâ€™re currently seeing and to show just how true that ominous statement has turned out to be. We also wanted to share what weâ€™re doing to combat the problem and how you can help. </p>\n<h3>How much (more) spam?</h3>\n<p>We have seen some significant year-over-year increases in the numbers of spam filtered by Akismet. Here is an illustration breaking down the daily averages by month for 2012 and 2013:</p>\n<p><a href="http://akismet.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/graph.png"><img src="http://akismet.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/graph.png?w=600" alt="Akismet Daily Spam Averages by Month, 2012 - 2013" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1020" /></a></p>\n<p>As you can see, successfully combatting over 100 million daily pieces of spam is the new normal. As general spam levels rise, so may the chance that some unwanted items will squeeze through our filters to hit your dashboard and comment queues. This is where we need you to ensure that you mark any such comments as spam so that theyâ€™re reported back to Akismet. This helps our software learn, evolve, and make better decisions moving forward. Because spammers evolve just as often.</p>\n<h3>What kind of spam?</h3>\n<p>All kinds, of course. But if we had to pick a winner so far in 2013, we would probably go with the compliment spammers. There are lots of variations within this category, sure, but the overall tactic remains the same. And unfortunately, we often see that folks are actually recovering comments like this from their spam folders. On this front, <a href="http://blog.akismet.com/2007/11/27/it-really-is-spam/">Markâ€™s post from 2007</a> is still very relevant and worth a read. Here are some samples of compliment spam, if youâ€™re curious: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Interesting Findings of the Blog World Â» Chuck Norris wants a Bible Curriculum in the Public Schools (Gasp!)<br />\n[...] Read the rest of this great post here [...]</p>\n<p>Very interestingâ€¦ as always!</p>\n<p>For the most part I agree with you and enjoy reading your posts.</p>\n<p>Hi, you have a jolly good post here, thanks for the good read</p>\n<p>[...] Check it out! While looking through the blogosphere we stumbled on an interesting post today.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>What should you do?</h3>\n<p>Let Akismet work its magic and correct it only when you need to. If you do, at any given time, experience a small influx of missed spam, thereâ€™s no need to become alarmed. Take a look at the number of comments that Akismet <em><strong>did</strong></em> successfully catch during that same timeframe and examine the accuracy rate (this will help determine whether or not there is a technical problem). Then, of course, mark the comments as spam so that Akismet can process the data. Do <strong>not</strong> place the comments in the trash â€” if you find something incredibly out of place, please feel free to <a title="Contact Akismet Support" href="http://akismet.com/contact">get in touch</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, and most importantly, always remember that Akismet learns from user feedback via missed spam and false positive reports. This means that, when you see something that Akismet has flagged as spam, know that other bloggers have agreed with its opinion. Have you ever seen those advertisements that claim â€œ9 out of 10 cats prefer this food!â€? Well, when you notice a comment in your spam folder, think of it as â€œ9 out of 10 bloggers say this is spam!â€ Donâ€™t get fooled by the bad guys.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, our awesome (and growing) team will continue working magic behind the scenes and ensuring that Akismet is your best weapon against spam.</p>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/akismet.wordpress.com/995/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/akismet.wordpress.com/995/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=blog.akismet.com&blog=116920&post=995&subd=akismet&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 02 Aug 2013 13:08:39 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"Anthony";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:20:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"WordPress.tv: WordCamp San Francisco 2013: Hallway Interviews Track 4";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wordpress.tv/?p=21005";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"http://wordpress.tv/2013/08/02/wordcamp-san-francisco-2013-hallway-interviews-track-4/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:690:"<div id="v-0EcSJgF0-1" class="video-player">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/21005/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/21005/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=21005&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/08/02/wordcamp-san-francisco-2013-hallway-interviews-track-4/"><img alt="WordCamp San Francisco 2013: Hallway Interviews Track 4" src="http://videos.videopress.com/0EcSJgF0/video-27a4c1ba6a_std.original.jpg" width="160" height="120" /></a></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 02 Aug 2013 12:12:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"WordPress.tv";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:20:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"Donncha: Like a dog and his ball";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"http://ocaoimh.ie/?p=89498487";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:53:"http://ocaoimh.ie/2013/08/02/like-a-dog-and-his-ball/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1095:"<p><img src="http://ocaoimh.ie/ocaoimh/2013/08/Like-a-dog-and-his-ball.jpg" alt="Like a dog and his ball" width="800" height="533" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89498488" /></p>\n<p>That there is Oscar, my shih tzu.

I canâ€™t imagine the sigh of relief they are breathing as well as the weight thatâ€™s been lifted off their shoulders. But!

Each author now has their own autosave stream, which stores things locally as well as on the server (so much harder to lose something) and thereâ€™s an interface for taking over editing of a post, as demonstrated beautifully by our bearded buddies in the video above.</li>\n<li><strong>Built-in HTML5 media player</strong> for native audio and video embeds with no reliance on external services.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Menu Editor</strong> is now much easier to understand and use.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Developer features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A new audio/video API gives you access to metadata like ID3 tags.</li>\n<li>You can now choose HTML5 markup for things like comment and search forms, and comment lists.</li>\n<li>Better filters for how revisions work, so you can store a different amount of history for different post types.</li>\n<li>Tons more <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.6">listed on the Codex</a>, and of course you can always <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&group=resolution&milestone=3.6">browse the over 700 closed tickets</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Band</h3>\n<p>This release was led by <a href="http://markjaquith.com/">Mark Jaquith</a> and <a href="http://geekreprieve.com/">Aaron Campbell</a>, and included contributions from the following fine folks.

that explains in more detail the reasoning behind the first post. It also contains apologies and although we could argue on whether their choice to customers should have been to opt-in or opt-out, the choice is there for customers regardless, which didnâ€™t exist before. Lots of lessons to be learned from this whole ordeal. I hope commercial plugin and theme companies took their notes and donâ€™t repeat the same mistakes.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Original Post:</h2>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/woothemeslogo.png" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-2368" alt="woothemes logo" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/woothemeslogo.png?resize=150%2C52" /></a>WooThemes <a title="http://www.woothemes.com/2013/08/a-sustainable-woothemes/" href="http://www.woothemes.com/2013/08/a-sustainable-woothemes/">has announced</a> a major restructuring of their pricing tiers related to their theme and plugin products. First off, I applaud WooThemes for being transparent about the pricing changes and the reasoning behind them. From a business perspective, the changes make sense. From their announcement post:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>- Weâ€™re increasing the prices of all of our products (<a href="http://www.woothemes.com/product-category/themes/">themes</a>, <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/plugins/">plugins</a> & <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/">WooCommerce extensions</a>.)</li>\n<li>- Weâ€™ve implemented a consolidated licensing system (the one weâ€™ve been using for plugins & WooCommerce until now), which now includes themes too.</li>\n<li>- Weâ€™re dropping our <em>Unlimited</em> pricing tiers in favour of a 25-site license tier.</li>\n<li>- Support and updates will be capped to one year after purchase (with the ability for you to extend this).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As expected, not everyone is happy about the changes, especially customers who purchased products that would have unlimited support and upgrades and could be used on unlimited sites. Those customers will be grandfather-ed into the new licensing system where they will receive 2 years of support and upgrades. After that time expires, they will need to renew their license. License renewals will have a substantial discount attached to them but if the license expires, youâ€™ll have to renew at full price.</p>\n<p>This change in the way they are doing business is no surprise to me. In fact, I thought this day would have arrived sooner. When I asked WooThemes employee Mark Forrester <a title="https://twitter.com/mark_forrester/status/362863756562272256" href="https://twitter.com/mark_forrester/status/362863756562272256">why this change wasnâ€™t made sooner</a>, this is what he said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our fast growth, varying product offering, tech and pricing models complicated things. But yes we wish weâ€™d done it earlier!</p></blockquote>\n<p>From the outside looking in, it appears that WooThemes could definitely afford to honor their commitments to customers in the unlimited pricing structure but at the same time, thatâ€™s a huge chunk of recurring revenue they would pass up. What weâ€™re seeing now is that WooThemes understands the costly mistake they made by offering unlimited anything and while they didnâ€™t have to, they did give those customers 2 years to get accustomed to the changes. However, I can also see the perspective that customers will now have to literally pay for their mistake, even if itâ€™s two years from now.</p>\n<p>I know how it feels to pay once for something labeled as unlimited and then later on in the productâ€™s life cycle, I end up having to pay again despite the fact that it was supposed to be a one time buy. The terms and conditions page of WooThemes affords them the opportunity to make changes that positively affect their business, even if the customer gets the low-end of the deal.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, WooThemes has made some necessary changes that will help cement the companyâ€™s existence well into the future.</p>\n<p>As for all other theme or plugin shops, if you are offering unlimited anything, please do yourself and your customers a favor and stop it. Itâ€™s getting to the point that if youâ€™re offering unlimited anything, you might as well be holding up a giant sign that says â€œ<em>Want To Go Out Of Business</em>â€œ.</p>\n<p>Related reading from David Peralty on <a title="http://peralty.com/2013/08/01/wordpress-products-versus-services/" href="http://peralty.com/2013/08/01/wordpress-products-versus-services/">WordPress Products Versus WordPress Services</a></p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/EDtuMs9HBr0" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 01 Aug 2013 18:54:36 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:20:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"Ping-O-Matic: Quick Tips: Optimize Titles and Permalinks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"http://blog.pingomatic.com/?p=93";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:52:"http://blog.pingomatic.com/2013/08/01/optimize-tips/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1836:"<p><a href="http://pingomatic.com/" target="_blank">Ping-O-Matic</a> is all about getting your new posts out into the world, ensuring your readers see your latest stuff, and driving more traffic to your site.</p>\n<p>What else can you do to make sure users find your content? Here are two quick tips and resources:</p>\n<h3>Optimize your page titles</h3>\n<p>Take the steps to optimize your site for SEO, starting with page titles. Our friends at <em><a href="http://build.codepoet.com/" target="_blank">Code Poet</a></em> recommend Joost de Valkâ€™s <a href="http://yoast.com/articles/wordpress-seo" target="_blank">WordPress SEO resource</a>, particularly a section on <a href="http://yoast.com/articles/wordpress-seo/#titles" target="_blank">optimizing your titles for SEO</a>.</p>\n<h3>Optimize your siteâ€™s permalinks</h3>\n<p>Our siteâ€™s permalinks should be clear and concise, yet reveal what our content is about. How long (or short) should they be? Our permalinks are like street addresses for our siteâ€™s pages â€” itâ€™s important to get these right so people â€” and bots! â€” donâ€™t get lost and can navigate our site structure. Our <em><a href="http://blog.pingomatic.com/feed/build.codepoet.com" target="_blank">Code Poet</a></em> pals also suggest this <a href="http://digwp.com/" target="_blank">digwp.com</a>Â resource on <a

Then, commenters leave questions and can vote on other questions according to which they would like to see answered. The interviewee then goes through and responds to any questions that he/she would like, and in any way that he/she prefers. </p></blockquote>\n<p>After spending three hours answering questions, here are a few of the ones I found to be the most interesting. </p>\n<p><em>Andrewry â€“ Hey Matt, I was at your State of the Word in SF and you talked about moving WordPress more towards being an application framework rather than a CMS or blog platform. What specifically do you have in mind for this (better settings API, developer features, etc)? And then if you could break backwards compatibility (which really isnâ€™t a option for WP), what would you really like to completely redo or add to WordPress? Thanks!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Matt â€“ First and foremost the most important things for a platform are stability, speed, and security. To do those well you need the ability to push updates and fixes as close to real-time as possible. And it needs to work in every language. User authentication, data and caching abstraction.</p>\n<p>A lot of what people think of as platform stuff is actually at the CMS layer â€” custom post types, taxonomy meta,</p>\n<p>If backwards compatibility wasnâ€™t a concern I would rename all the inconsistent column names and variables to match our style guide, drop TinyMCE, simplify the user roles and capabilities system, replace widgets with page blocks, redo the admin menu system, denormalize the DB, flatten dependencies and deep hierarchy in function execution, and completely reorganize the code so the bare minimum of files are included with any given request.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Ericmann â€“ What do you see as the biggest challenge facing WordPress (in the context of competitive software or just un-met customer needs) for the next year?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Matt â€“ By far and away itâ€™s the high attrition rate of new users. We look at posting a lot in that context but I think itâ€™s far more important to look at customization â€” theme discovery and tweaking, widgets, menus.</strong></p>\n<p><em>GetSource â€“ If you could wave a magic wand and instantly rewrite WordPress in any programming language, which would it be?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Matt â€“ <a href="http://golang.org/" title="http://golang.org/">Go.</a> :)</strong></p>\n<p><em>ShaneHudson â€“ Hi Matt, Iâ€™m a long time WordPress dev (since day 1 moreorless) so thanks very much for starting it. Just wondering what your opinion of Ghost is? <a href="http://www.tryghost.org/" title="http://www.tryghost.org/">http://www.tryghost.org/</a></em></p>\n<p><strong>Matt â€“ I left a lot of thoughts in the comments on this puff piece:</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3013086/open-company/who-will-pick-up-where-wordpress-left-off" title="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3013086/open-company/who-will-pick-up-where-wordpress-left-off">http://www.fastcolabs.com/3013086/open-company/who-will-pick-up-where-wordpress-left-off</a></p>\n<p>They say or imply lots of things about WordPress that arenâ€™t true. Theyâ€™ve also done things like had a quote from me looking like I was endorsing Ghost on their Kickstarter page even after I asked them to remove it several times. (Lots of people were confused or thought it was a plugin for WP.)</strong></p>\n<p>Of course I had to add this one!</p>\n<p><em>WriteNoWrong â€“ Hey Matt, where do you think the future of the independent WordPress news community lies, with your recent purchase of WPTavern and the recent sale of WP Daily to WP Engine? Do you think there is a space for an impartial WordPress news website?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Matt â€“ Iâ€™m glad that new ones are being started as fast as old ones are shutting down. There is some really interesting stuff going on in the community and I think thereâ€™s space for real journalism and strong commentary.</strong></p>\n<p><em>VegasGeek â€“ Of all the WordCampâ€™s youâ€™ve been to around the globe, what was the most unusual location for the event itself and, separately, the after party?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Matt â€“ Oh by far and away the strangest location was Davao in the Philippines. I canâ€™t find any pictures at the moment, but my talk was essentially at a restaurant with a swimming pool courtyard â€” the audience was on the other side of the pool from me, and the food buffet was behind me so when the Q&A got slow people would grab food. The PA system had an echo because I think it was normally used for karaoke. And then the bats came out!</p>\n<p>Best after-party is hard to pick, but I had a great time after WordCamp Las Vegas which aligned with my 25th birthday a few years ago.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Eddiemoya â€“ How directly involved are you in ongoing development of core? Are you relatively hands on, do you ever drive decision making or do you leave it to the community?</p>\n<p>On a completely different subject.</p>\n<p>I met you at WordCamp Chicago this year (I told you about a widget plugin that turns them into a post type and such).</p>\n<p>I created these wooden WordPress logos with my 3D Printer, I meant to give you one but I forgot about it. You still want one?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Matt â€“ Would love a wooden WP logo, as long as itâ€™s not a fauxgo. :)</p>\n<p>Iâ€™m as involved in WordPress development as I was 10 years ago, it just manifests itself in ways that tend to be a lot more behind the scenes and less visible, which I donâ€™t mind as Iâ€™m way more interested in things moving forward and the results than credit or recognition for any specific thing. (I get plenty of recognition regardless, donâ€™t need more.) The only downside is that folks who I donâ€™t work with on a day-to-day basis assume that my role at Automattic or WP is more as a traveling figurehead or â€œevangelistâ€ which can rub me the wrong way sometimes.</p>\n<p>For 3.8 Iâ€™m going to take a swing at the release lead role again, which should be fun.</p>\n<p>The most important thing Iâ€™ve done since WP started, though, isnâ€™t in a line of code or a feature people use, itâ€™s getting the right people involved and creating an environment for them to thrive. Itâ€™s the single most important thing any founder can do, whether of an OS project, a non-profit, or a for-profit company even though thereâ€™s not a single thing you can point to as the result of it other than the overall success and movement of the project.</strong></p>\n<p><em>eddiemoya â€“ Thanks for your response! I have to admit that I asked this questions for the very reason you just explained â€“ I wasnâ€™t sure if you were just a figurehead for WordPress core, and kept more to running/development for Automattic, or if you kept heavily involved in development and decision making in core.</p>\n<p>Seems like it would be a difficult balance to strike â€“ between looking uninvolved or like your doing things behind closed doors on one hand â€“ and looking like your dictating/micromanaging where things go.</p>\n<p>I think it will be a good move for you to be visible in your activity â€“ I think it will make things seem more open, rather than a vague suggestion that you might or might not have been involved.</p>\n<p>Oh â€“ and these are the logos I made. <a href="http://eddiemoya.com/2013/06/30/wooden-3d-printed-wordpress-logos-wcchi/" title="http://eddiemoya.com/2013/06/30/wooden-3d-printed-wordpress-logos-wcchi/">http://eddiemoya.com/2013/06/30/wooden-3d-printed-wordpress-logos-wcchi/</a></em></p>\n<p><strong>Matt â€“ Itâ€™s more fun being visible at first, but it also draws more flak and criticism that impedes process, for lack of a better way of putting it the normal conversations and back and forth thatâ€™s an everyday and critical part of OS development get warped when Iâ€™m a part of them, some people digging in or disagreeing as much for trying to get â€œpointsâ€ over someone powerful as much as the substance of the issue. If I engage I end up looking dictatorial and take time away from more important tasks, or if I donâ€™t it disenfranchises a contributor. I have contributed anonymously a few times before under different accounts.</strong></p>\n<p><em>jb510 â€“ What individual do you think is the most under recognized contributor to the WordPress community at large?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Matt â€“ Thatâ€™s a tough oneâ€¦ Iâ€™m going to say the volunteers on the support forums. There are 2M+ posts there, and itâ€™s easy to forget that a huge number of WP users end up in the forums and get help that allows them to use the software when they wouldnâ€™t otherwise be able to.</strong></p>\n<p>Last but not least</p>\n<p><em>ashenkar7 â€“ Hi Matt, have you read Chris Lemaâ€™s blog post <a href="http://chrislema.com/wordpress-for-the-enterprise/" title="http://chrislema.com/wordpress-for-the-enterprise/">http://chrislema.com/wordpress-for-the-enterprise/</a> What is your response? </em></p>\n<p>Matt â€“ I have. Itâ€™s also funny because I think Gartner is about to come out with a â€œmagic quadrantâ€ that puts us in the crappy quadrant (low vision and ability to execute). Their leaders? Adobe, Sitecore, SDL, Oracle, HP, Opentextâ€¦</p>\n<p>I completely agree with Chris on all the ways that enterprise currently works, and their concerns. (People assume because we choose to do things differently that we donâ€™t understand the other side.) But Iâ€™m not willing to compromise getting better software into the hands of users as quickly as possible, if that means Gartner thinks weâ€™re a visionless niche player so be it.</p>\n<p>Weâ€™ve done long-term support branches before, it was a big development burden and almost no one used it or cared. There will be businesses that embrace keeping their technology moving at the speed the web does, and there will be those that go out of business and become irrelevant.</p>\n<h2>3 Hours Worth</h2>\n<p>Iâ€™m not going to post every one of the questions and responses but these are the ones that really caught my eye. I encourage everyone to check out the Reddit post and browse through the questions and responses yourself.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/Qya2b0_r-ts" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 01 Aug 2013 11:00:33 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:20:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:57:"WPTavern: My First Ever WordCamp San Francisco Experience";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=8180";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:109:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/2bQxXjrVlOo/my-first-ever-wordcamp-san-francisco-experience";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22897:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/499.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/499.jpg?resize=150%2C150" alt="WordCamp San Francisco Badge" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-8228" /></a>Since I started writing about WordPress in 2007, WordCamp San Francisco has been labeled as the grandest WordCamp of them all. Itâ€™s where the <a href="http://2006.wordcamp.org/" title="http://2006.wordcamp.org/">first event of its kind</a> took place which started a revolution in WordPress meetups. Unfortunately, Iâ€™ve been unable to attend any WordCamps in the San Francisco until this year. The following is my experience crammed into a blog post. <span id="more-8180"></span></p>\n<h2>Day 1</h2>\n<p>Day 1 started hours before the actual event. For me at least. During the weekend, I stayed at <a title="http://www.starwoodhotels.com/westin/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=1981" href="http://www.starwoodhotels.com/westin/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=1981">The Westin San Francisco</a>. At 2 A.M. someone tried to secretly smoke a cigarette in a non-smoking hotel because the fire alarm went off. The alarm had a sound that was awful, akin to something found in the <a title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J-y2rFfny8" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J-y2rFfny8">original Star Trek</a>. After walking down 26 flights of stairs at 2 A.M. we discovered that it was a false alarm. I didnâ€™t get much sleep after that.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/462.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/462.jpg?resize=224%2C300" alt="Fire Trucks At The Westin" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8200" /></a></p>\n<p>Opening remarks began at 9 A.M. but I didnâ€™t attend a single session during the day. Before the event, I volunteered to be part of the <a title="http://2013.sf.wordcamp.org/2013/07/17/live-stream-attendees-welcome-to-the-hallway-track/" href="http://2013.sf.wordcamp.org/2013/07/17/live-stream-attendees-welcome-to-the-hallway-track/">Hallway Track team</a>. This team of individuals walked around the event with cameras and did on the spot interviews with attendees, speakers, and sponsors. If you watched the live stream, our interviews wereÂ  between sessions. The team consisted of myself, Dre Armeda representing <a title="http://dradcast.com/" href="http://dradcast.com/">DradCast</a> and Jason Tucker representing <a title="http://www.wpwatercooler.com/" href="http://www.wpwatercooler.com/">WPWaterCooler</a>. I figured that any sessions I missed would be available on <a title="http://wordpress.tv" href="http://wordpress.tv">WordPress.TV</a> in the near future and I could spend most of my time networking with people. Iâ€™m not sure of the exact setup we had but the handheld cameras with the directional boom mics worked out great. The setup worked so well, Iâ€™m considering asking if I could borrow or get a WordCamp Camera kit for myself for video interviews at the events I attend. I think I completed around a dozen interviews throughout the day. I tried to mix it up between people most of the community knows about and those attending their first WordCamp.</p>\n<p>The only negative experience I had for day one was the lunch. Not the food but the lack of it. Unfortunately, I became so engrossed in a conversation with <a title="http://jaco.by/" href="http://jaco.by/">John James Jacoby</a> that I almost missed lunch entirely. When I went down to grab a bite to eat, the only thing left was a potato and a cookie. Donâ€™t get me wrong, the lemon iced poppy seed cookies were fantastic but I was hoping for something more filling. I was not the only one who didnâ€™t get any of the main course. Fortunately, the folks in charge of food brought out a container of fresh cooked burgers for those that didnâ€™t anything to eat.</p>\n<p>This is the first WordCamp Iâ€™ve ever attended where the first day of sessions was on a Friday. This really screwed me up internally as I thought Friday was Saturday, Saturday was Sunday, etc. But, by the time Sunday rolled around, it made the weird schedule totally worth it. As what usually happens at these events, people have their cliques and each group gathered for dinner to meet and talk to each other as most of the WordPress centric folks were distributed employees, and this was an opportunity to be face to face. I on the other hand was invited by WPEngine to a hosted dinner which included a number of other individuals in the WordPress community to talk WordPress during a fine dining experience. Not only do they do a good job of hosting websites, they know how to host a good dinner as well.</p>\n<div id="attachment_8205" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/469.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/469.jpg?resize=224%2C300" alt="Coca Cola Braised Pork Shoulder" class="size-medium wp-image-8205" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Coca Cola Braised Pork Shoulder</p></div>\n<p>The invitation only dinner took place at <a title="http://www.luellasf.com/" href="http://www.luellasf.com/">Luella SF</a>. Luella is a charming Bistro in Russian Hill, slightly outside of downtown San Francisco. We were treated to a three-course meal complete with wine pairings. The food was amazing. Personally, I had the Coca-cola braised pork-shoulder as my main course and the orange fritters drizzled in honey for dessert. The pork was incredibly tender. Overall, a solid dining experience enhanced by being surrounded by some great WordPress people. I want to personally thank the guys from <a title="http://wpengine.com/" href="http://wpengine.com/">WPEngine</a> for the dinner as well as providing travel to and from the event. By the end of the night, I was pretty tired. I traded some morning sessions for sleep. During WordCamps, sleep is a difficult thing to obtain.</p>\n<h2>Day 2</h2>\n<p>After sleeping in, I arrived at the Mission Bay Conference center just in time for <a title="http://wordpress.tv/2013/07/29/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2013/" href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/07/29/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2013/">Matt Mullenwegâ€™s State Of The Word presentation</a>. I managed to find a spot to stand up in the conference room Matt was presenting in. Iâ€™ve never seen a room filled with as many people as it was during his session. It was incredible. The presentation was simulcasted to the secondary conference room so Iâ€™m unsure as to whether the audience was the same but I bet it was. I was able to nod my head in agreement and express joy to many of the things Matt said. I looked over the conference room during parts of his presentation and noticed others nodding in agreement or in some cases, disagreement. Until WordCamp San Francisco 2013 Iâ€™ve never been able to be part of the live audience for the State Of The Word. It was an awesome experience and I highly encourage anyone who is enthusiastic about WordPress to put it on your bucket list.</p>\n<p>After Mattâ€™s presentation, it was time for lunch. On Day 2, we had BBQ. This time around, I was early to receive a healthy helping of food that lasted me all day. The food was delicious. No complaints from me!</p>\n<p>After lunch, I attended one other presentation, this time by John James Jacoby on <a title="http://2013.sf.wordcamp.org/session/bbpress-and-buddypress-what-where-why-who-and-how/" href="http://2013.sf.wordcamp.org/session/bbpress-and-buddypress-what-where-why-who-and-how/">going beyond the blog with BuddyPress and bbPress</a> (presentation will be uploaded to WordPress.tv very soon). His session was dedicated to showing sites that utilized bbPress and BuddyPress in interesting ways. He also showcased how either could be themed and reshaped in a way that it was hard to tell which parts of the site were using BuddyPress or bbPress. It was an inspirational talk that proved both were capable of being excellent social tools without having to look like a cookie-cutter site. While listening to John, itâ€™s clear that he has a passion for not just bbPress and BuddyPress, but forums in general. In fact, his passion for bbPress reminds me a lot of Matt Mullenwegâ€™s passion for WordPress.</p>\n<div id="attachment_8206" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/470.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/470.jpg?resize=224%2C300" alt="John James Jacoby" class="size-medium wp-image-8206" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Triple J On The bbâ€™s</p></div>\n<p>Most of the day was spent talking to individuals both known and unknown about WordPress, bbPress, and anything under the sun. After Day 2, it was time to head to the after party at the brand new Automattic Lounge. Unfortunately, I never had the chance to visit the <a title="http://www.flickr.com/photos/titanas/3576534598/" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/titanas/3576534598/">old office location at Pier 38</a> which Iâ€™ve been told had a wonderful view. Their <a title="http://peterslutsky.com/2013/05/14/pics-touring-automattics-new-office/" href="http://peterslutsky.com/2013/05/14/pics-touring-automattics-new-office/">new lounge on Hawthorne Street in San Francisco</a> is a great co-working space. They used the general space downstairs to host a DJ with a free alcoholic bar. I had a great time but if you ever find yourself at the WordCamp San Francisco after-party and there is free booze, please limit yourself as the next day is usually contributor day. I failed to do that and ended up with a mild hangover. Lesson learned! The after party was a great time and the lounge was an excellent host. However, being surrounded by loud music didnâ€™t do much for my already hoarse voice.</p>\n<div id="attachment_8213" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/479.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/479.jpg?resize=224%2C300" alt="WCSF After Party" class="size-medium wp-image-8213" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">WCSF After Party</p></div>\n<h2>Day 3</h2>\n<p>Day 3 started out rough. I woke up with a mild headache, slightly buzzed and needed more sleep. However, day 3 was contribute day! Contribute day was set aside on a Sunday to give anyone who was attending the event a chance to spend some of their time contributing directly to a portion of the WordPress project that interested them. While the attendance was nowhere near Mattâ€™s State Of The Word Presentation, enough people showed up that just about every table was filled with volunteers. In fact, the attendance impressed me. The entire room which 12 hours earlier was filled with booze and loud music had turned into a giant collaborative effort. I originally thought that the amount of people in the space would generate so much noise that it would be hard to talk to each other. However, I was stunned to hear how quiet it was once we had volunteer groups sorted out. I looked up from my position numerous times and just sat there watching the amount of people with their heads down working on the portion of the WordPress project that interested them the most. I can only describe contribute day as a <strong>surreal experience</strong>.</p>\n<div id="attachment_8217" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/483.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/483.jpg?resize=300%2C223" alt="WCSF Contributor Day" class="size-medium wp-image-8217" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">WCSF Contributor Day</p></div>\n<p>Considering I donâ€™t know a lick of code, I volunteered my time at the Support table along with a dozen other people. <a title="http://ipstenu.org/" href="http://ipstenu.org/">Mika Epstein</a> was the leader of our group as she has seen her share of WordPress.org support threads. I ended up training one individual to sign up for a Gravatar and to get started on the support forums. Within the next few hours, we were able to plow through a bunch of the recent forum threads of that day, deleting spam posts and marking accounts as Bozoâ€™s, the WP.org support forum equivalent of spammer. One of the coolest things Mika did was go around the table and give each volunteer a custom forum title. Although I didnâ€™t ask for it, I was granted forum moderator access based on my experience in the WordPress community. However, since I havenâ€™t had the chance to read the WP.org support forum contributor handbook, I made a boo boo by supporting someone looking for paid services. I learned my lesson and wonâ€™t be doing that again.</p>\n<p>The highlight for me during contribute day was finally being able to talk to someone about a small user-experience issue I encountered. I wonâ€™t explain it here but instead, quote the text from my first ever <a title="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24859" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24859">trac ticket</a> that Mika helped me create.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When you have a large amount of images in the media library, and use the search function when adding new media, there is a noticeable lag from entering the search term to when any results (if any) show up.</p>\n<p>This was confirmed on WPTavern.com which contains about 900 images. We did not see the same results on a site that only contained 300 images. However, on all sites if there are no results a delay is seen between the time a term is entered and when results are displayed.</p>\n<p>So Iâ€™m suggesting that a placeholder image or a status indicator that tells users that the search process is occurring would solve this issue.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While I didnâ€™t have a patch, I think it will be fairly trivial to add some sort of status indicator. However, I wish I had some sort of badge by WordPress.org or something that told me congratulations on my first ticket. Something that I could put into a digital trophy case. Alas, I have the experience to remember if nothing else. Even after all these years of writing about WordPress, actually creating something on Trac is a scary barrier to cross. But the experience is so much better with a mentor to provide a helping hand. The last thing I need to be doing is creating more work for the WordPress developers.</p>\n<p>Speaking of developers that attended the event, some of them were hard to speak to. Not because they didnâ€™t have anything to say, but because they are obsessed with improving their project. This lead me to write and publish the following tweet: <em>You donâ€™t understand WordPress core developers until you meet them. Naturally they are obsessed with improving WordPress.</em></p>\n<div id="attachment_8216" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/482.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/482.jpg?resize=300%2C223" alt="WCSF Contributor Day" class="size-medium wp-image-8216" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">WCSF Contributor Day</p></div>\n<p>Overall, Contribute day was a huge success. Work was accomplished on most of the different facets that make up the WordPress project. There was even a group dedicated to bbPress and BuddyPress that ended up with at least one feature improvement. I would love to see more of these contribute days in the future spread to other WordCamps. Perhaps not even an entire day or an entire room dedicated to it. Iâ€™d be fine with a Contribute Bar similar to the Happiness Bar which is staffed by one or two individuals very close to the core team. Individuals with questions, bug fixes, or bug reports could spend time at the bar. I realize this may take away from precious development time to WordPress but in the long run, I think the project would be better off for it. Communicating how to contribute to core via text or IRC is not for everyone and generally, can be taken out of context very quickly. I bet a more personable approach ala contribute day would do wonders to get people over that barrier that prevents them from diving in and contributing.</p>\n<h2>Wrap Up</h2>\n<p>Overall, I had a memorable experience. I didnâ€™t have the chance to explore the city which gives me another reason to come back next year. While this post is well over 2,000 words, it only scratches the surface of my entire WCSF experience. I talked to so many people, got wind of so many projects, and had the chance to meet co-workers and discuss things in person without the need for Skype or any other communication tool. Over the next several days, Iâ€™ll be publishing everything Iâ€™ve learned about the WordPress project and the satellite sites springing up around it. If you ever get the opportunity to attend WordCamp San Francisco, do whatever you can to make it!</p>\n\n<a href="http://www.wptavern.com/?attachment_id=8196" title="WCSF Photos"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/456.jpg?resize=150%2C150" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="Photos From My Trip" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.wptavern.com/?attachment_id=8197" title="458"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/458.jpg?resize=150%2C150" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="458" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.wptavern.com/?attachment_id=8198" title="459"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/459.jpg?resize=150%2C150" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="459" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.wptavern.com/?attachment_id=8199" title="460"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/460.jpg?resize=150%2C150" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="Super Duper Is Good!" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.wptavern.com/?attachment_id=8207" title="471"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/471.jpg?resize=150%2C150" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="471" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.wptavern.com/?attachment_id=8204" title="467"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/467.jpg?resize=150%2C150" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="Haiku Board" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.wptavern.com/?attachment_id=8203" title="466"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/466.jpg?resize=150%2C150" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="Schedule Of Events" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.wptavern.com/?attachment_id=8201" title="463"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/463.jpg?resize=150%2C150" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="463" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.wptavern.com/?attachment_id=8202" title="464"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/464.jpg?resize=150%2C150" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="Sour Dough French Toast" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.wptavern.com/?attachment_id=8208" title="472"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/472.jpg?resize=150%2C150" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="472" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.wptavern.com/?attachment_id=8209" title="473"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/473.jpg?resize=150%2C150" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="473" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.wptavern.com/?attachment_id=8210" title="475"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/475.jpg?resize=150%2C150" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="S.F.

It works by adding the call to action â€œincentiveâ€ tab that can offer something like â€œ<em>Save 5% Now</em>â€ or â€œ<em>Get Free Shipping</em>â€œ. Once clicked a window pops up presenting the site viewer with options on how to get a special promo code that will unlock their promised discount. The options for unlocking the promo code include <strong>Tweeting, Liking on Facebook, Sharing on LinkedIn, G+1 or signing up to your mailing list</strong>. Once one of these actions has been triggered, the customer is presented with the coupon code, which they can copy and paste into their cart for immediate usage.</p>\n<p>Hereâ€™s a quick one minute video on how JustUno works:<br />\n</p>\n<p>I like the â€œ<em>social bribery</em>â€ concept, as it helps to grow your social traffic for little back-end buy-in cost. This plugin allows you to control which services you would like to use, including limiting to just the email sign-up. For those who have coupon code capable shopping carts this is a great way to promote your site while giving those who do so a small reward. It might also be used to promote a â€œ<em>hidden link</em>â€ to your special content or the password to a private post. Use your imagination. Let me know if you think of other creative uses for this discount gate.</p>\n<p><a title="Custom Bulk Quick Edit" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-bulkquick-edit/" target="_blank">Custom Bulk/Quick Edit</a> allows you to easily add previously defined custom fields to the edit screen bulk and quick edit panel to a precise degree unlike anything Iâ€™ve seen previously. It allows you to sort and mash-up your posts and post types in the posts or pages view, and then edit them with laser accuracy. Even in quick edit. For instance, if I wanted to include â€œ<em>color</em>â€ in the sortable post list and as an option in quick edit, this plugin would allow me to get into the display settings, modify the query of what is displayed in the list and then allow editing on a multiple scale. You can change finite details in multiple posts, down to post types, secondary data and additional fields. There are both free and premium versions. See which is right for your own needs and make determinations as to what works best for you. The capabilities of this freaks me out. I have about a billion needs for sites that I am working on that involve custom sorts and multiple edits at once across different categories. This one can save hours of time in doing so.</p>\n<p>Here is another video about how Custom Bulk/Quick Edit performs with additional premium features enabled:<br />\n</p>\n<p><a title="WP Bouncer" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-bouncer/" target="_blank">WP Bouncer</a> is a plugin that only allows one device login per user at one time. It â€œbouncesâ€ the logged in person and provides a warning message. Pretty good security for those of us that might leave a work/home browser open while editing. Itâ€™s not as advanced as the mega-complex Launchkey that we spoke about last week, but a good solution for keeping only one person logged in at once. I know the new WP version may address some of these issues with the collaboration features (I only saw the video), but this is a great solution in the meantime. I had to try it just because of the WPTavern name! Every tavern needs a bouncer. Too bad it doesnâ€™t work on readers too.. lol</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/YkLUVv-E11k" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 31 Jul 2013 17:46:14 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Marcus Couch";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:20:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"Alex King: My Biggest Take-Aways from WordCamp San Francisco 2013";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://alexking.org/?p=17932";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"http://devin.reams.me/2013/lessons-from-wordcamp-san-francisco-2013/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:953:"<blockquote><p>My biggest take-aways from WordCamp San Francisco 2013 were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 water bottles\n<li>\n<li>4 t-shirts</li>\n<li>10 stickers</li>\n<li>2 pair of sunglasses</li>\n</ul>\n<p>â€¦but seriously, the sessions I attended were great and I was able to see the direction that the WordPress project and community are headed.

Today we have five additions that are worth taking a closer look at. But before you install these on a live site, make sure that you properly test them on a secondary staging site first. That way you know the plugin is an ideal match for you and can work well with the other plugins you already have installed. Remember that this post is not to be considered an endorsement or official review, but a sampling of the newest offerings from the Repository. <span id="more-8104"></span></p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/failure_to_launch_800_6282.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8138" alt="LaunchKey - Failure to Launch" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/failure_to_launch_800_6282.jpg?resize=150%2C150" /></a><a title="LaunchKey WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/launchkey/" target="_blank">LaunchKey</a> is an authentication plugin that promises to â€œKill All Passwordsâ€ for your WordPress logins. You begin by installing the plugin, downloading the app (iOS or Android) and then confirming your account via email. From there you are to login to launchkey.com and create an app API that will authenticate with your mobile device. Hereâ€™s where my investigation halted, at first at least. For the first 45 minutes, no matter what browser I tried, it would never let me log into my account on their website to create the API keys needed. I reached out to Launchkey on Twitter and finally had things working to API key stage after 3 uninstalls and re-installs. Once I had the API keys, it ground to a halt on my first attempt to retry wp-admin login. No matter what I did, {â€œerrorâ€:â€invalid_requestâ€} was the result in my browser when routing through their OAuth servers.</p>\n<p>After 3 API key changes on their site, it finally worked. So how does it work once it actually gets going? It uses your mobile device to allow you to login to your site based only on your Launchkey username. Once the username is entered, your mobile device is alerted and a notification comes up allowing you to â€œslide upâ€ a toggle that permits the login. It also allows you to log off simply by sliding the â€œlockâ€ to the right. One early issue that I found was that no matter what site I had tried to login as, the iPhone app always identified the authentication request as coming from â€œLaunchkey OAuthâ€ rather than any particular site name or URL. I can see where this would get really confusing really fast when dealing with multiple domains. How would I know what site is being logged into? Once more, if I am logging out by sliding on the names, how can I tell what Iâ€™m logging out of? Itâ€™s an interesting app/plugin combo adding another layer of security to your installation, or at least lending all your site credential trust to a third-party funnel, which has itâ€™s own risks attached to it when misused. I like the concept and appreciate the quick help of the Twitter support team in getting me operational. Personally though, I donâ€™t see the need for the average WordPress user to implement this. Itâ€™s not worth the risks or the cumbersome setup time. Thatâ€™s just my opinion and your own needs may vary. For me, the launch key was turned and the rocket never got very far off the pad.</p>\n<p>Itâ€™s a neat app. Will I keep it installed? Not at the moment. Iâ€™ll check back with this one after they have a few revisions to see if they are ready for Prime Time. For now though, Iâ€™ll wait.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/buyhimabeer.png" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8129" alt="Buy Him A Beer" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/buyhimabeer.png?resize=150%2C150" /></a><a title="Buy Him A Beer WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/buy-him-a-beer/" target="_blank">Buy Him A Beer</a> is the perfect plugin for Jeff to install on this site. Iâ€™d rather call this one â€œBuy Me some single-malt Scotchâ€, but for continuity sake, weâ€™ll stick with the beer references. This plugin is not like your typical PayPal based donation prompt. It actually allows you to pick out what beer you would like to buy someone. From a domestic standard to a seasonal microbrew rarity, â€œBuy Him A Beerâ€ is a fun way to encourage tips or donations in your WordPress installation. The plugin runs on the database at buyhimabeer.com to feed the beer data into the system, but no account signup is required. Itâ€™s a great way to prompt donations to your site and fun for the person making the donation. Iâ€™ve tested it and it also works for females too, despite the name. I forsee a whole series of this. Buy me lunch, send me a pizza, pay for my dry cleaning and perhaps even feed my starving dog with a nice selection of treats. Of course thatâ€™s the marketer in me, always going for those heartstrings in order to make a conversion. Who know if weâ€™ll install this on WPTavern, but itâ€™s worth a shot (or at least a beer).</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/user-language-switch.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8147" alt="User Language Switch" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/user-language-switch.jpg?resize=150%2C150" /></a><a title="User Language Switch" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/user-language-switch/" target="_blank">User Language Switch</a> allows you to change the language on the front end or the back-end with just a simple flick of the switch. This is truly helpful if you work with people who speak another language and you want to switch back and forth to edit and work on the same WordPress installation. It also allows you to translate posts back and forth with an association between the native language and the translated versions. Several years ago I worked with a team in Spain on a WordPress project that could have really used a plugin like this for the back-end that we could have toggled languages on. If it ever comes up again, Iâ€™ll be sure to give this one a try on a live site.</p>\n<p>That will round out todayâ€™s batch of plugins. After all that struggle with LaunchKey, I really could use a beer. Anyone want to donate one? lol.

Remember to test your plugins on a staging site before going live. Make sure that all your plugins can party together without causing too much damage. Once youâ€™re good to go, move them over to your live site and get the party started. Also remember that these are not reviews or official endorsements, but observations of whatâ€™s new out there that you may want to try out if the subject matter, functionality and layout meets your own individual site needs. OK, letâ€™s get plugged in! <span id="more-8092"></span></p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/wpinterstitial.png" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8116" alt="WP Interstitial" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/wpinterstitial.png?resize=150%2C150" /></a><a title="WPStitial WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wpstitial/" target="_blank">WPstitial </a> displays an interstitial ad screen when users visit a specific page, or any page within your WordPress installation. An Interstitial ad is often used by the larger content sites such as magazines or media outlets. It is a web page that is displayed before an expected content page, often to display advertisements or confirm the userâ€™s age. Well now itâ€™s no longer just the big boys that get to play in the interstitial sandbox. You too can thrill your readership with full-page ads designed to hide the content for just a few more seconds. I joke about that part, because interstitial ads, when used properly can be a very effective way to market to first time viewers of a web site. Whether it be baiting your readers with requests to follow you on social channels or enticing them with special offers, this plugin provides a platform in which to create easy full-page interstitial ads with the ease of the WordPress content editor. Full shortcode and HTML embedding is allowed on the page, as is a control over how often a person will see. In addition you can simply embed the URL of another site via iFrames. The plugin is also mobile optimized, so you can show the same ads on both platforms, formatted perfectly. Other controls include wait time adjustments and the cycle of ads that is rotated. Overall a good plugin to check out for yourself if you are looking for additional revenue streams for your high-traffic sites or to simply raise awareness of a particular event or campaign.</p>\n<p><a title="Only One Category WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/only-one-category/" target="_blank">Only One Category</a>, as the name implies limits the a post to having just one, single checked category. What a blessing! I canâ€™t tell you how many times Iâ€™ve checked a category, only to forget to un-check whatever default category was already selected. When this happens it generally puts things where they shouldnâ€™t be and causes headaches having to go back in just to uncheck one little box. Now Iâ€™ll never have to again, and neither will you.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/visualizer.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8118" alt="Visualizer Chart Plugin" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/visualizer.jpg?resize=150%2C150" /></a><a title="Visualizer WordPress Chart Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/visualizer/" target="_blank">Visualizer</a> is another Google Charts API plugin that allows you to access the on-the-fly chart-making capabilities of Google Charts. Unlike other plugins of a similar theme, this one has all the bells and whistles built right into it, allowing you to create any type of chart that Google Charts offers directly within WordPress. From pie charts to line graphs, dot grids to candlesticks. If thereâ€™s data to be illustrated, thereâ€™s unlikely to be another source out there with the same capabilities all packed into a single plugin.</p>\n<p><a title="WP Image Borders WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-image-borders/" target="_blank">WP Image Borders</a> helps you easily add or remove custom border effects to your uploaded images. A few shows back on WordPress Plugins A-Z, a gentlemen left us an audio comment asking for an alternative for a Drupal module called â€œImageCacheâ€. I was never into Drupal, but this feature was quite amazing, allowing on-the fly image formatting and editing, including orientation correction, color adjustments, bevel, shadows, glow and many other effects that we often have to do offline at a time-consuming rate. While on the hunt for an answer to our listenerâ€™s request, I came across something similar that was just released in the Repository called WP Image Borders. While itâ€™s nothing like the aforementioned ImageCache capability, it does provide some of the same â€œon-the-flyâ€ image processing power. If you want to add drop shadows to all your images or make them round cornered, this is a good plugin to do that. It will not alter the original image and turning off the plugin will simply revert all your old images back to their original styles. Would love to see what people out there can create with this!</p>\n<p><a title="Simple Donation Manager" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-donation-managersdm/" target="_blank">Simple Donation Manager</a> assists in recognizing those who have contributed to the cause, no matter what that might be. The plugin uses a shortcode based system that displays donors and beneficiaries for a particular cause or fund-raising drive. So not only will it list out who donates, but it can list out who receives the help as well. While not quite Kickstart quality, this has a lot of uses for non-profit and charitable organizations out there who have the need to display such information with the ease of a shortcode. Full contact info can be used, including their method of payment for the donation.</p>\n<p>Thatâ€™s it for this edition of The Daily Plugin. Join us again tomorrow as we dig into the deepest chasm of the WordPress Plugin Repository in search of hidden resources and new gems to behold.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/RJPvl0ECb7w" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 25 Jul 2013 15:25:15 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Marcus Couch";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:20:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"WPTavern: The Daily Plugin for 07-23-2013";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=8052";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/BAscCKypc38/the-daily-plugin-for-07-23-2013";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4810:"<p>Welcome once again to another installment of The Daily Plugin. Today weâ€™re pleased to see that the WordPress Plugin Repository has just hit 26,000 plugins in the index. This is quite an accomplishment! Iâ€™m grateful to all the developers out there who put in thankless days and sleepless nights creating these magnificent plugins. They canâ€™t all be a perfect 10 plugin, but the simple fact that people are making a solid effort to participate in the community is very commendable.</p>\n<p>Before we begin, make sure that you test out all these plugins on a staging site. Itâ€™s always best to create a mirror of a live site with an identical set of plugins. Then install the new plugin to see how it interacts with the others. After a day or so, youâ€™ll get to know the functionality, speed and performance of the site with the new plugin installed. If everything seems to be cool, then itâ€™s probably safe to remove the plugin from your â€œquarantineâ€ and use it on an actual live site. <span id="more-8052"></span></p>\n<p><a title="YouTube Comments" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/youtube-comments/" target="_blank">YouTube Comments</a> is yet another tentacle in the power of the commenting system. This little gem allows you to automatically pull in the comments from a YouTube linked video from within the post. I like this because it keeps my WordPress installation as the central hub for everything despite how many social services that I want to hook it to on the outside. The plugin allows comments by all users logged into YouTube. Hopefully this doesnâ€™t become abused or has some degree of control of spam.</p>\n<p><a title="Blog Watch WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/blog-watch/" target="_blank">Blog Watch</a> helps you monitor the competition or fellow content creators right in your dashboard. It runs on both RSS and ATOM feeds. You simply add the feed URL and the posts will be inserted in the dashboard module. An added bonus is that if you do not know a specific feed URL, the plugin will attempt to locate it for you based on the main URL of the blog you want to monitor. This could be used to monitor the blogging activity streams of your favorite authors, sites with similar interests or anything you choose. Heck, why not double up and add the <a title="WP Tavern Feed" href="http://wptavern.com/feed/" target="_blank">WPTavern feed</a> to it as well, ok?</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/time-difference.png" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8086" alt="Time Difference" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/time-difference.png?resize=150%2C150" /></a><a title="Time Difference" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/time-difference/" target="_blank">Time Difference</a> calculates the amount of time between the current date of your WordPress installation and a date that you signify in shortcode form. The date can be either in the past or in the future. I like the versatility of this plugin, as it can act as a countdown timer to an event and as a running stopwatch of something that has started. It could be used in a number of practical ways. Days left in Summer, countdown to when school starts, days since you were born and on and on. Since itâ€™s shortcode based, youâ€™ll be able to use this within content as well as within a widget.</p>\n<p><a title="Free Voice Comment System" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/uemotioncom-free-voice-comment-system/" target="_blank">Free Voice Comment System</a> is another plugin I tried in hopes of finding a free solution for Speakpipe. This plugin ideally would have the same functionality in that a site viewer would be able to record an audio comment with just one click-through their browser. In the case of this plugin, it runs off a service called uemotion.com, a social messaging site based on audio recordings. I could not get the plugin to function at all after installation, from requesting an API key on down. This one is simple not ready for prime time, as the site crashes every time you try to request a key. I tried it on 3 different staging sites with the same result. Oh well. Iâ€™ll keep on searching.</p>\n<p>Last Friday I mentioned that there would be some news for those fans of the column that are commuters seeking an audio version of The Daily Plugin. After some consideration and discussion with Jeff, Iâ€™ve decided to give the people what they want and create a daily audio recording. We will wait until the next version of WordPress officially drops so that we can take advantage of using the new audio and video capabilities within the Media center. I canâ€™t wait!</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/BAscCKypc38" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 24 Jul 2013 18:23:49 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Marcus Couch";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:20:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"Dev Blog: WordPress 3.6 Release Candidate 2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2649";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/07/wordpress-3-6-release-candidate-2/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1307:"<p>The second release candidate for WordPress 3.6 is now available for download and testing.</p>\n<p>Weâ€™re down to only a few remaining issues, and the final release should be available in a matter of days.

For starters, these two get bonus points for adding a settings link that is accessible from the Plugin management page. I wish more plugins would do that. Just drag the icons representing the social networks you want to use to the Enabled Social Services box. </p>\n<div id="attachment_8077" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/FloatingSocialBarSetup.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/FloatingSocialBarSetup.jpg?resize=500%2C368" alt="Floating Social Bar Setup" class="size-large wp-image-8077" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Configuring This Plugin Is Easy!</p></div>\n<p>You can alter the text that displays to the left of the icons, determine where those buttons show up, add your Twitter username and configure the interval to update stats which are displayed to the right of each icon. I believe this varies between themes but depending upon how long the text is before the social icons, it will force some of them to the next line, which is not pretty. </p>\n<div id="attachment_8078" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/FloatingSocialBarIcons.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/FloatingSocialBarIcons.jpg?resize=495%2C96" alt="Floating Social Bar Icons" class="size-full wp-image-8078" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">As seen in the Twenty Eleven Theme</p></div>\n<p>My personal preference is to have sharing icons located below the post content, near some of the meta data as seen on WPTavern articles. This plugin doesnâ€™t allow that, at least not from its settings page. This is one of the reasons why Publicize by Jetpack will be a better option. Publicize gives users options to control the look of the icons and where they are located. With Floating Social Bar, the icons are stuck at the top of the post.</p>\n<p>This plugin provides a quick and easy way to display sharing icons without all of the additional functionality that comes with Publicize in JetPack. If thatâ€™s what you need, this plugin is excellent. If youâ€™re looking for more flexibility, especially for how these icons are displayed, I suggest using Publicize in Jetpack. </p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/q7E9HaMqxAY" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 23 Jul 2013 00:18:10 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:20:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"WPTavern: Creating A Digital Publication In WordPress With The IssueM Plugin";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=8068";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:128:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/nR1Xamk6kl4/creating-a-digital-publication-in-wordpress-with-the-issuem-plugin";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1990:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IssueMLogo.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IssueMLogo.jpg?resize=74%2C81" alt="Issue M Logo" class="alignright size-full wp-image-8074" /></a>Built by LewAyotte, Peter Ericson, and Glenn Ansley the recently released open-source plugin known as <a href="https://issuem.com" title="https://issuem.com">IssueM</a> provides publishers the opportunity to harness the ease of WordPress to turn their site into an Issue based publication. After taking a look at <a href="http://issuem.com/showcase/" title="http://issuem.com/showcase/">their showcase</a>, I decided to try out the plugin for myself. </p>\n<p>I installed the plugin on my demo test site and had a hard time maneuvering around and getting things setup the way they were supposed to. Out of the box, itâ€™s difficult to know how things are supposed to be setup. I hope in the future, these guys take full advantage of <strong><a href="http://www.paulund.co.uk/introduce-wordpress-pointers" title="http://www.paulund.co.uk/introduce-wordpress-pointers">Pointers</a></strong> that were added to the core of WordPress 3.3.

I donâ€™t know what it is about this plugin but I found it difficult to use and setup. After watching the following video, it makes a little more sense but not much.</p>\n<div class="aligncenter"></div>\n<p>Iâ€™m sharing this plugin so you could at least take it for a test drive yourself and report back with your experience.

WPVote was described by many as a Digg like site but for WordPress. </p>\n<p><strong>First off Ben, tell us a little bit about who you are and what youâ€™ve been up to these days.</strong></p>\n<p>Hi Jeff. I have been working online since the early 2000â€²s, and started with WordPress around 2004. I released a free theme that was one of the first added to <a href="http://wordpress.com/" title="http://wordpress.com/">wordpress.com</a> â€“ and after I started <a href="http://prothemedesign.com/" title="http://prothemedesign.com/">prothemedesign.com</a> which I still run today. Currently I am still building themes, with the best being premium themes on wordpress.com.</p>\n<p><strong>Itâ€™s been 3 years since the launch of WPVote. In that period of time, are you happy with the results of your experiment?</strong></p>\n<p>WPVote has been a fantastic learning experience for me. Honestly â€“ it never took off as I would have liked â€“ but I was able to achieve everything I set out to do. In addition, and what many people probably donâ€™t think of â€“ is that when building WPVote I created a product that I sold on <a href="http://prothemedesign.com/" title="http://prothemedesign.com/">prothemedesign.com</a> â€“ and it has done quite nicely for me.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/wpvotelogo.png" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/wpvotelogo.png?resize=238%2C50" alt="WPVote Logo" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3101" /></a></p>\n<p>That said â€“ since you first asked me about doing this interview WPVote has been under a sustained flood of traffic, which has made the site un-responsive. There are patterns to the traffic, but the blocks I have put in place havenâ€™t helped and the rest of the site doesnâ€™t respond. Without improving my hosting (which isnâ€™t financially viable) I think the future of wpvote is in doubt at the moment :(</p>\n<p><strong>Can you share some statistics regarding the site such as submissions, new user registrations, etc?</strong></p>\n<p>Well â€“ <a href="http://wpvote.com/" title="http://wpvote.com/">wpvote.com</a> currently has <strong>10,022 users</strong> and <strong>1,962 public posts</strong>. I havenâ€™t measured how many but wpvote automatically deletes old posts that point to websites/web pages that no longer exist. As such, thereâ€™s probably a couple hundred posts that have been removed. Thereâ€™s currently about 20 users who are consistently posting new content to the site, with 5 to 10 new posts a week being published. The (legitimate) traffic to the site isnâ€™t huge but it has a good pagerank so it can be a nice bonus for your site.</p>\n<p><strong>From the outside looking in, I havenâ€™t seen WPVote become a destination hotspot to see whatâ€™s happening in the world of WordPress. Why do you think that is?</strong></p>\n<p>My biggest problem, with everything I do (Iâ€™m well aware that this is a weakness), is marketing. I donâ€™t have the network â€“ or the skills/ knowledge â€“ that others in the community have. Poststat.us has shown that this type of website in the WordPress niche can work â€“ and Iâ€™m really pleased Brian managed to do it. In addition Poststat.us has managed to keep the content higher quality â€“ presumably through a more manual review process which is bound to have helped.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPVoteFrontPage.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPVoteFrontPage.jpg?resize=398%2C265" alt="WPVote Front Page" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8063" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Are there any specific lessons youâ€™ve learned by operating WPVote in the past three years?</strong></p>\n<p>Iâ€™ve learned a lot about programming and developing complex themes. I probably shouldnâ€™t say this about a product I still sell, but Iâ€™d quite like to rewrite Nominate. Iâ€™ve also learned a lot about WordPress itself â€“ using functionality you wouldnâ€™t normally use in a theme. Things like submitting posts â€“ and integrating spam management tools, more complex admin tools, and using wp-cron to automatically check on validity of old content. Itâ€™s been a really good way to grow as a developer.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/NominateTheme.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/NominateTheme.jpg?resize=516%2C305" alt="Nominate Theme" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8064" /></a></p>\n<p>In my article <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/ben-gillbanks-launches-wpvote" title="http://www.wptavern.com/ben-gillbanks-launches-wpvote">where I described the launch of WPVote</a>, I mentioned near the end that it would be cool to see something like WPVote replace the WordPress planet feed so the community played a larger role in determining what was shown on the front page. Have you had any inquiries regarding this? Is it something you would like to pursue?</p>\n<p>Iâ€™ve had a few inquiries to buy/invest in the site but Iâ€™ve turned everyone down so far. Iâ€™m not really in this for the money â€“ I wanted to do it because I think WordPress is awesome and I wanted to try to help promote the community.</p>\n<p>I havenâ€™t had any inquiries regarding syndicating the content for something more <a href="http://wordpress.org/" title="http://wordpress.org/">wordpress.org</a> related but doing something like that would be awesome â€“ Iâ€™m certainly open to considering things like this (if I can ever get the site live again).</p>\n<p><strong>Iâ€™d like to know your thoughts regarding PostStat.us and their recent redesign. It looks like the site is gaining traction and is starting to gain more user based submissions.</strong></p>\n<p>I think the PostStat.us redesign is fantastic. IMO Itâ€™s not very visual â€“ and the design is quite dry. It plays down the social/ community aspect â€“ but the content is great and itâ€™s building itself up nicely. Since PostStat.us is mostly about the community and writing opinion pieces based upon submitted content/ news â€“ I think it would be nice to showcase the other sites more, possibly through website screenshots (like on wpvote) or perhaps some other means.</p>\n<p>The thing I am missing with WPVote is the community actively submitting and (more importantly) voting on the content. If people donâ€™t interact then thereâ€™s no point running the site. PostStat.us does have people voting on content, and the manually curated content which probably makes it a more desirable destination for people looking for WordPress content.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you have anything on tap with the WPVote website that youâ€™d like to share?</strong></p>\n<p>At the moment my focus with wpvote is trying to get it back online. In the future I would quite like to rewrite it as a voting plugin but I have so many other things I want to do that I donâ€™t know when/ if that will happen.</p>\n<h2>Bonus Content:</h2>\n<p>Check out Benâ€™s <a href="http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/2009/12/building-wpvote-wordpress/" title="http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/2009/12/building-wpvote-wordpress/">7 part series</a> that goes through the process of getting WPVote from idea, to working reality. </p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/N_vR4q15Mns" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 22 Jul 2013 18:46:48 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:9:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Tue, 06 Aug 2013 17:37:43 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:14:"content-length";s:6:"199674";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Tue, 06 Aug 2013 17:30:27 GMT";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 250";s:13:"accept-ranges";s:5:"bytes";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20130203172254";}';
